# HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2

## Introduction:
In the vast ecosystem of the internet, where seamless communication between clients and servers is paramount, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) serves as the foundation. Over time, HTTP has undergone significant advancements to accommodate the ever-growing demands of modern web applications. In this blog post, we delve into the evolution from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2, highlighting the key differences between the two protocols and their implications for web performance and efficiency.

## HTTP/1.1: The Foundation
HTTP/1.1, introduced in 1999, revolutionized the way information was exchanged on the World Wide Web. It brought standardized methods for clients (such as web browsers) and servers to communicate, enabling the retrieval and display of web content. However, as the internet landscape evolved and web applications became more complex, the limitations of HTTP/1.1 became increasingly apparent.

#### Key Limitations of HTTP/1.1:
1. *Head-of-line blocking  :*
In HTTP/1.1, only one request per connection can be processed at a time. If a resource takes longer to load, it blocks subsequent requests, leading to latency issues and slower page load times.
2. *High latency  :*
The protocol requires multiple connections for parallel resource fetching, resulting in increased latency, especially on high-latency networks.
3. *Redundant header information  :*
HTTP/1.1 sends header information with each request and response, leading to unnecessary overhead and decreased efficiency.

## Introducing HTTP/2: A Paradigm Shift
In response to the shortcomings of HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 was developed and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 2015. This new iteration aimed to enhance web performance, security, and efficiency by introducing several groundbreaking features.

#### Key Features of HTTP/2:
1. *Multiplexing  :*
Perhaps the most significant improvement, HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent and received in parallel over a single TCP connection. This eliminates head-of-line blocking and significantly reduces latency, leading to faster page load times.
2. *Header Compression  :*
HTTP/2 employs efficient header compression algorithms, reducing redundant header information and minimizing overhead, which further enhances performance and efficiency.
3. *Server Push  :*
HTTP/2 introduces server push, enabling servers to proactively send resources to clients before they are requested. This optimizes the loading of web pages by anticipating and delivering necessary resources in advance.
4. *Binary Protocol  :*
Unlike the textual format of HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, which is more compact and easily parsed by machines. This simplifies the processing of requests and responses, contributing to improved performance.

> *Implications for Web Development and Performance:*<br/>
> The adoption of HTTP/2 has significant implications for web developers, performance engineers, and end users alike. By leveraging its advanced features, developers can design faster, more efficient web applications that deliver an improved user experience. Performance optimizations such as resource prioritization and efficient data transfer are now achievable with HTTP/2, leading to reduced page load times and increased scalability.

## Conclusion:
The transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of web protocols. With its revolutionary features and performance enhancements, HTTP/2 represents a significant step forward in the quest for a faster, more efficient web. As web developers and organizations embrace this new standard, we can expect to see further innovations and improvements in the realm of web performance and user experience.

# 2. Understanding Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript

JavaScript is a powerful and flexible programming language, and one of its core features is the use of objects. Objects in JavaScript allow developers to model and manage complex data structures in a way that is both intuitive and efficient. In this blog, we will delve into the concept of objects in JavaScript, explore their internal representation, and understand how they work under the hood.

## What is an Object in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is a string (or Symbol) and each value can be any data type, including another object. Objects are used to store and organize data in a structured manner. They can be created using various methods, with the most common being the object literal syntax.

#### Creating Objects
Object Literal
The simplest way to create an object is by using the object literal syntax:

```javaScript
let person = {
    name: "Bharath Parthipan",
    age: 22,
    isStudent: true,
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
};
```

Using the new Keyword
Another way to create an object is by using the new keyword with the Object constructor:

```javascript
let person = new Object();
person.name = "Bharath Parthipan";
person.age = 22;
person.isStudent = false;
person.greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
};
```

#### Properties and Methods
An object in JavaScript can have properties and methods. Properties are values associated with a key, and methods are functions associated with a key. In the above example, name, age, and isStudent are properties, while greet is a method.

#### Internal Representation of Objects
Understanding the internal representation of objects in JavaScript helps in writing efficient and optimized code. Internally, JavaScript engines use a variety of techniques to represent and manage objects.

#### Property Storage
JavaScript engines, like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), use hidden classes (also known as "shapes" or "maps") to manage objects' properties. When an object is created, a hidden class is assigned to it. As properties are added, the hidden class evolves. This allows the engine to optimize property access and method invocation.

For example, consider the following sequence:

```javascript
let obj = {};
obj.a = 10;
obj.b = 20;
```

Initially, obj is created with a hidden class representing an empty object. When property a is added, a new hidden class is created to represent an object with property a. When property b is added, yet another hidden class is created to represent an object with properties a and b.

#### Inline Caches
JavaScript engines use a technique called inline caching to speed up property access. When a property is accessed, the engine records the location of that property. Subsequent accesses to the same property can be significantly faster because the engine can skip the process of looking up the property location.

#### Prototype Chain
Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object from which it can inherit properties and methods. The prototype chain is a mechanism by which properties and methods are shared among objects. When a property or method is accessed, the engine first looks for it in the object itself. If it’s not found, the engine looks up the prototype chain until it either finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain.

Here’s an example illustrating the prototype chain:

```javascript
let animal = {
    type: "Animal",
    makeSound: function() {
        console.log("Some generic sound");
    }
};

let dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.bark = function() {
    console.log("Woof!");
};

dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Some generic sound
dog.bark();      // Outputs: Woof!
```

In this example, dog is created with animal as its prototype. When dog.makeSound() is called, the engine looks up the prototype chain and finds makeSound in the animal object.

#### Best Practices for Using Objects
To make the most of objects in JavaScript, consider the following best practices:

1. Use Object Literals: Prefer object literals over the new Object() syntax for simplicity and readability.
2. Avoid Excessive Property Reconfiguration: Frequent addition or removal of properties can lead to de-optimization. Define all properties at the time of object creation whenever possible.
3. Leverage Prototypes: Use prototypes to share methods and properties among similar objects. This not only saves memory but also improves performance.
4. Be Mindful of Property Access: Frequently accessed properties should be defined directly on the object to avoid prototype chain lookups.

## Conclusion
Objects are a fundamental part of JavaScript and understanding their internal representation can help you write more efficient and optimized code. By using object literals, leveraging prototypes, and being mindful of property access patterns, you can take full advantage of the power and flexibility that objects offer in JavaScript.
